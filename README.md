# pymapnik3

Python 3.x bindings for the [mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik)
map-rendering engine.

Currently in development and *not* ready for use.

## Goals

 * Easy, reliable build.
 * Support Mapnik 3.1.
 * Support Python 3, but not 2.
 * Similar API to python-mapnik, but more consistent.
 * Support what's needed by [fhdb](https://github.com/larsga/fhdb) 
   *plus* `TextSymbolizer`.
